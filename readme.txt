An animation with the current date on the roman catholic liturgical year. It contains links to mass lectures and the saints calendar online.

== Description ==

We have tested this plugin on a WordPress 4.4.2 installation successfully. It should work fine in 4.7.1.

This is a SVG animation which shows the current Roman Catholic liturgical year. The animation arranges the liturgical times along with the corresponding Gregorian dates. 

The length in days of Advent, Christmas, Ordinary Time, Lent and Easter are displayed when passing the mouse over the calendar.
